3. Relevant Information:

    The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page,
    has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
    It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been
    size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

    It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and
    pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal
    efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

    Four files are available on this site:
